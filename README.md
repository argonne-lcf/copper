# Co-operative Caching Layer for Copper â€‹

As the number of nodes grows large (i.e. > 512) redundant IO requests for the same 
resources can overwhelm the underlying storage system causing extremely high latency. 
This project aims to intercept and cache shared IO operations in distributed node memory.
This elinates all nodes reaching the underlying storage system for a resource needed by
all nodes.
